# Automation

- For Windows Users Only

Just add the binary to your windows path and you be able to use from your command prompt or powershell interface

--> DO NOT expect any documentation from me, i'm too lazy.. just go through the source code and you'll know what to do


-oh and, you'll probably want to change the directory paths in the source code and compile again before using
(also change and use your github link where its says 'YourGithub')

-That's it.. enjoy your laziness!
